# What is Cloud Computing
- Delivery Model with services via internet
  - Storage(Including all the services)
  - Compute Power
  - Networking
  - Analytics(Performance of telemetry data)

# Scalability
Allocation and Deallocation
- Size
  - CPU
  - Memory
  - Storage

- Vertical Scaling
  - Scale up & Scale down sizes of one resource

- Horizontal Scaling
  - increase amount of resources 

# Elasticity
Ability to scale resources automatically
Understand user & system workload 
- Auto Scaling

# Agility
- ability to request resources in short time

# Fault Tolerance
- ability to remain up and running during components and service failure

# Disaster Recovery
- Create image in other region
- Set automated DNS routhing

# High Availability
- ability to measure up time
  - system failure
  - system patching

Availability = Uptime/(Uptime + Downtime)

# Economies of scale
- Small Company, High Cost
- Medium Company, Medium Cost
- Large Company, High Cost

# Capital Expenditure VS Operation Expenditure
- CapEx -> must be future proof
- OpsEx -> Pay as you good model

Hardware over time , value lower

# Consumption Based Model
- Cost Managemnet + Billing

# IaaS vs PaaS vs SaaS (Cloud Sercice models)
IaaS - user uses cloud provided hardware services to run a software and install own platform and software
PaaS - user uses cloud provided hardware and platform, develop just software

# public, private, hybrid

# Geographies, Regiions & Availability Zones
- Data Center
- Regions
- Region Pairs
- Geographies
- Availability Zone
- Benefit and usage
